    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach focuses on the strategic management of expected disruptions, typically due to adverse weather conditions like typhoons or tornadoes. Unlike the first approach, this method deals with an entire day and assumes the probabilistic nature of disruption. In addition, the model incorporates multiple airports, considering the transition of an aircraft with the given probability of disruption. To address these issues, the second approach minimizes the revenue loss of the entire airports due to the expected disruption. This follows the method from the most cited work (paper: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25768908) and the general network models (book: http://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/AMP-Chapter-08.pdf)."

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use real data compiled by Amadeus, made available as part of the [ROADEF 2009 Challenge: Disruption Management for Commercial Aviation](https://www.roadef.org/challenge/2009/en/). This dataset is based on flight plans for an airline in France. For this notebook, we have pre-processed this dataset and stored the information in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current flight plan: The currently planned set of flights and their aircraft assignments assuming that there is no weather disruption (i.e., all airports operate at full capacity).\n",
    "- Aircraft starting and ending positions: Where should each aircraft start the day and end the day? This information is necessary to ensure that aircrafts are where they need to be for the next day so that the disruption does not extend into the next day.\n",
    "- Passenger itinerary: The number of passengers and the price per ticket sold for each flight. This information is useful to assess the revenue brought in by each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though the data used in this example is from 2006, the optimization model is ambivalent of the data. For any new flight plan and predicted future disruption levels, the model will optimally solve the routing and flight service decisions."

    "1. Manual allocation efficiently uses up to 75-95% of the available flights ((0.75-0.95) Ã— \\alpha Ã— total_departure/arrivals), though not as effectively as the computerized optimization model, which can utilize up to 100%.\n",
    "2. Manual allocation cannot evaluate a value of a certain flight in terms of revenue loss because of the urgency nature of rescheduling under disruption. It rather tries to maximize the utilization of flights. \n",
    "3. Manual allocation begins with random operation plans, which is represents human-error, covering 50-95% of available flights. These plans may be adjusted as employees further attempt to optimize within their constraints."
