    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use real data compiled by Amadeus, made available as part of the [ROADEF 2009 Challenge: Disruption Management for Commercial Aviation](https://www.roadef.org/challenge/2009/en/). This dataset is based on flight plans for an airline in France. For this notebook, we have pre-processed this dataset and stored the information in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current flight plan: The currently planned set of flights and their aircraft assignments assuming that there is no weather disruption (i.e., all airports operate at full capacity).\n",
    "- Aircraft starting and ending positions: Where should each aircraft start the day and end the day? This information is necessary to ensure that aircrafts are where they need to be for the next day so that the disruption does not extend into the next day.\n",
    "- Passenger itinerary: The number of passengers and the price per ticket sold for each flight. This information is useful to assess the revenue brought in by each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though the data used in this example is from 2006, the optimization model is ambivalent of the data. For any new flight plan and predicted future disruption levels, the model will optimally solve the routing and flight service decisions."

    "\n",
    "For two flights $f_1$ and $f_2$, the flight transition $f_1$-$f_2$ is *feasible* if the arrival time of $f_1$ is before the departure time of $f_2$, and the destination of $f_1$ is the same as the origin of $f_2$.\n",

    "For example, from the data, the aircraft A380#1 (which is an Airbus 380) starts the day at airport CFE. From here, it can either take flight 4296 (CFE-ORY) at 5:40am or flight 4298 (CFE-ORY) at 10:48am. Once it gets to ORY, it will have multiple options for the rest of the day's route. In total,  A380#1 has eight flight paths (see visualization below).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compactly store all the feasible flight-to-flight transitions, we create a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG). The vertices are the flights, and the directed edges are feasible transitions. Use the interactive tool below to visualize the DAG for each aircraft."
