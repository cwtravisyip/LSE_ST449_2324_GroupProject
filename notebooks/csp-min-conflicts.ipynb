    "### The `FlightSchedulerCSP` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class extends a generic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) to specifically handle flight scheduling under certain constraints like runway availability and disruption times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__init__` Method\n",
    "- Initializes the flight scheduler model with the necessary parameters and calls the `CSP` class constructor.\n",
    "- Parameters:\n",
    "  - `flights_df`: DataFrame containing flight details.\n",
    "  - `disruption_level`: Minutes of delay caused by a disruption.\n",
    "  - `num_runways`: Number of available runways.\n",
    "  - `neighbor_window`: The time window in minutes to consider flights as neighbors.\n",
    "  - `time_slot`: The interval in minutes for generating time slots.\n",
    "- It also initializes a special 'diverted' slot for handling unscheduled flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `create_variables` Method\n",
    "- Creates a list of variables for the CSP. Each flight code is considered a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `create_domains` Method\n",
    "- Generates the domains (possible values) for each variable (flight). Domains are the potential time slots for each flight, considering the disruption level.\n",
    "- The method also appends the `diverted_slot` to each flight's domain as a fallback option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `create_neighbors` Method\n",
    "- Defines neighbors for each flight based on the `neighbor_window`. Neighbors are flights scheduled close in time to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `create_constraints` Method\n",
    "- Sets up the constraints for the CSP. The constraints determine whether a particular assignment is valid.\n",
    "- Key constraints include checking if assigning a time slot to a flight would exceed runway capacity and managing the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Min-Conflicts Search Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `min_conflicts` Function\n",
    "- A hill-climbing algorithm to solve the CSP. It iteratively tries to reduce the number of conflicts in the current assignment.\n",
    "- Includes a safeguard to handle cases where a solution isn't found within the maximum steps.\n",
    "- Returns the final assignment or diverts unresolved flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `min_conflicts_value` Function\n",
    "- Chooses the best value (time slot) for a variable (flight) that results in the least number of conflicts.\n",
    "- If there's a tie, the earliest time slot is selected. If no valid time slot is found, it resorts to the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `argmin_tie`: A utility function to choose the minimum element from a sequence, breaking ties based on a provided key function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- This custom CSP model is designed to handle a complex flight scheduling problem.\n",
    "- It manages constraints like runway capacity and disruption times, and it includes a mechanism to handle flights that can't be scheduled within the given constraints by diverting them.\n",
    "- The min-conflicts search algorithm is used to find a near-optimal solution, considering the constraints and the nature of the problem.\n",
    "- The model is flexible enough to handle various numbers of flights, runways, and disruption scenarios."

    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The modifications made to the FlightSchedulerCSP class, including the addition of a diverted_slot and adjustments to time slot generation and constraints, provides in a custom flight scheduling CSP model. Let's summarize the key aspects of this experiment and compare it with tree-based search algorithms using utility functions.\n",
    "Summary of the Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Time Slot Frequency: The time_slot parameter allows you to set the frequency of time slots. This change enables more precise scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended Time Slot Range: The time slots are generated up to the last possible time considering the disruption level and the time slot interval. This ensures a comprehensive range for rescheduling flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diverted Slot for Unsolvable Conflicts: A diverted_slot set to a future date acts as a fallback for flights that cannot be accommodated. This helps in managing unsolvable conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints Adjustments: The constraint function now accounts for the number of flights scheduled at a time and compares it with the available runway capacity. It also accommodates the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling of Local Minima: The min-conflicts algorithm includes a check to prevent getting stuck in local minima, ensuring that the algorithm provides a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection of Earliest Time Slot: The algorithm selects the earliest time slot that minimizes conflicts, or if not feasible, assigns the flight to the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of the CSP Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility in Scheduling: Customizable time slot intervals offer more control over the scheduling process.\n",
    "- Efficient Handling of Conflicts: The ability to divert flights provides a clear solution for otherwise unsolvable scheduling conflicts.\n",
    "- Adaptability to Various Scenarios: The CSP model can adapt to different runway capacities and disruption levels.\n",
    "- Prevention of Stagnation: Safeguards against local minima ensure the algorithm always returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons of the CSP Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased Complexity: The added features and parameters make the model more complex and potentially harder to manage.\n",
    "- Risk of Suboptimal Solutions: The use of a diverted slot, while practical, might lead to suboptimal scheduling outcomes.\n",
    "- Dependence on Parameter Settings: The effectiveness of the model heavily relies on the chosen values for parameters like time_slot and neighbor_window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison with Tree-Based Search Using Utility Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSP vs. Tree-Based Search: CSP focuses on finding a solution that satisfies all constraints, while tree-based search algorithms aim to find an optimal solution based on a utility function.\n",
    "- Handling of Conflicts: CSPs, especially with the addition of the diverted slot, can handle conflicts more flexibly compared to tree-based searches, which might require more complex utility functions to manage similar scenarios.\n",
    "- Scalability and Performance: Tree-based searches can be more computationally intensive, especially for large problem spaces, whereas CSPs with the min-conflicts heuristic can be more efficient in finding satisfactory solutions.\n",
    "- Optimality of Solutions: Tree-based searches are more likely to find the most optimal solution, but at the cost of increased computational effort. In contrast, CSPs may quickly find a satisfactory solution but not necessarily the most optimal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the CSP model is capable to handle large state spaces quickly. While it offers a practical approach to managing unsolvable conflicts, it may not always provide the most optimal scheduling compared to tree-based search algorithms focused on maximizing a utility function."

    "# Conflict Resolution\n",
    "Early Termination Strategy (\"early\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This strategy stops the algorithm once all flights have an assigned time slot, even if conflicts still exist. It doesn't necessarily mean a globally conflict-free solution, but rather that each flight has at least one time slot assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Quick Results: It provides a solution faster, as it doesn't insist on resolving all conflicts.\n",
    "- Practicality: It can be practical in real-world scenarios where perfect solutions are rare, and some level of conflict is acceptable.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Possible Conflicts: There may still be unresolved conflicts, requiring manual intervention or further decision-making.\n",
    "- Suboptimal Assignments: Some flights might be assigned to less desirable time slots just to ensure every flight has a slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forced Resolution Strategy (\"force\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This strategy forces a resolution after a certain number of steps (500 in your case) by assigning each conflicted flight to its earliest possible time slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Conflict Resolution: It actively reduces conflicts by forcing assignment of conflicted flights to their earliest slots.\n",
    "- Balance: Offers a balance between efficiency and thorough conflict resolution.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Suboptimal Timing: Might assign flights to times that are too early or inconvenient, disregarding preferences.\n",
    "- Arbitrary Cutoff: The step count (500) at which this strategy kicks in is arbitrary and may not suit all datasets or scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversion Strategy (\"divert\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Similar to the forced resolution strategy, but here, after a set number of steps, all remaining conflicted flights are assigned to a 'diverted' slot, effectively removing them from the normal schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Clear Conflict Resolution: All conflicts are resolved by removing problematic flights from the regular schedule.\n",
    "- Simplicity: Simplifies the decision-making process as it provides a clear action for unresolved conflicts.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Loss of Options: Diverting flights can be seen as a last resort and might not always be the most practical or desirable solution.\n",
    "- Over-Simplification: May not reflect the complexity and nuances of real-world flight scheduling, where complete diversion might be impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptability: Each strategy has its merits and is adaptable to different operational constraints and objectives. The choice of strategy should be influenced by the specific requirements of the scheduling context (e.g., airport capacity, passenger convenience, operational costs).\n",
    "- Implementation Complexity: The implementation of these strategies is relatively straightforward, but the choice of strategy can significantly impact the practical utility of the solutions generated.\n",
    "- Optimality vs. Practicality: There's a trade-off between seeking an optimal solution (less conflict) and a practical solution (quick assignment with manageable conflict). The chosen strategy should align with the operational goals of the flight scheduler.\n",
    "- Manual Intervention: In all cases, especially with \"early\" and \"divert\" strategies, some manual review or additional decision-making might be necessary to handle the assigned schedules effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, these strategies might be used in combination or in different phases of problem-solving, depending on the operational priorities and constraints at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose Early if your primary goal is to quickly assign time slots to all flights, acknowledging that some level of conflict or suboptimal scheduling might remain.\n",
    "- Choose Divert if operational simplicity, clear conflict resolution, and realism are your primary concerns, and you're equipped to handle the logistical and customer service challenges of diverted flights.\n",
    "- Choose Force if minimizing disruptions and maintaining passenger satisfaction are more critical, and you're prepared to manage the complexities and potential resource strains that come with tightly packed schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the best option depends on your specific operational priorities, resource capabilities, and the level of flexibility you have in managing scheduling challenges."
