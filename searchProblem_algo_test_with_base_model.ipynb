    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The modifications made to the FlightSchedulerCSP class, including the addition of a diverted_slot and adjustments to time slot generation and constraints, provides in a custom flight scheduling CSP model. Let's summarize the key aspects of this experiment and compare it with tree-based search algorithms using utility functions.\n",
    "Summary of the Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Time Slot Frequency: The time_slot parameter allows you to set the frequency of time slots. This change enables more precise scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended Time Slot Range: The time slots are generated up to the last possible time considering the disruption level and the time slot interval. This ensures a comprehensive range for rescheduling flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diverted Slot for Unsolvable Conflicts: A diverted_slot set to a future date acts as a fallback for flights that cannot be accommodated. This helps in managing unsolvable conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints Adjustments: The constraint function now accounts for the number of flights scheduled at a time and compares it with the available runway capacity. It also accommodates the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling of Local Minima: The min-conflicts algorithm includes a check to prevent getting stuck in local minima, ensuring that the algorithm provides a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection of Earliest Time Slot: The algorithm selects the earliest time slot that minimizes conflicts, or if not feasible, assigns the flight to the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros of the CSP Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility in Scheduling: Customizable time slot intervals offer more control over the scheduling process.\n",
    "- Efficient Handling of Conflicts: The ability to divert flights provides a clear solution for otherwise unsolvable scheduling conflicts.\n",
    "- Adaptability to Various Scenarios: The CSP model can adapt to different runway capacities and disruption levels.\n",
    "- Prevention of Stagnation: Safeguards against local minima ensure the algorithm always returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons of the CSP Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased Complexity: The added features and parameters make the model more complex and potentially harder to manage.\n",
    "- Risk of Suboptimal Solutions: The use of a diverted slot, while practical, might lead to suboptimal scheduling outcomes.\n",
    "- Dependence on Parameter Settings: The effectiveness of the model heavily relies on the chosen values for parameters like time_slot and neighbor_window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison with Tree-Based Search Using Utility Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSP vs. Tree-Based Search: CSP focuses on finding a solution that satisfies all constraints, while tree-based search algorithms aim to find an optimal solution based on a utility function.\n",
    "- Handling of Conflicts: CSPs, especially with the addition of the diverted slot, can handle conflicts more flexibly compared to tree-based searches, which might require more complex utility functions to manage similar scenarios.\n",
    "- Scalability and Performance: Tree-based searches can be more computationally intensive, especially for large problem spaces, whereas CSPs with the min-conflicts heuristic can be more efficient in finding satisfactory solutions.\n",
    "- Optimality of Solutions: Tree-based searches are more likely to find the most optimal solution, but at the cost of increased computational effort. In contrast, CSPs may quickly find a satisfactory solution but not necessarily the most optimal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the CSP model is capable to handle large state spaces quickly. While it offers a practical approach to managing unsolvable conflicts, it may not always provide the most optimal scheduling compared to tree-based search algorithms focused on maximizing a utility function."

    "We use real data compiled by Amadeus, made available as part of the [ROADEF 2009 Challenge: Disruption Management for Commercial Aviation](https://www.roadef.org/challenge/2009/en/). This dataset is based on flight plans for an airline in France. For this notebook, we have pre-processed this dataset and stored the information in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current flight plan: The currently planned set of flights and their aircraft assignments assuming that there is no weather disruption (i.e., all airports operate at full capacity).\n",
    "- Aircraft starting and ending positions: Where should each aircraft start the day and end the day? This information is necessary to ensure that aircrafts are where they need to be for the next day so that the disruption does not extend into the next day.\n",
    "- Passenger itinerary: The number of passengers and the price per ticket sold for each flight. This information is useful to assess the revenue brought in by each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though the data used in this example is from 2006, the optimization model is ambivalent of the data. For any new flight plan and predicted future disruption levels, the model will optimally solve the routing and flight service decisions."
