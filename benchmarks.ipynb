    "The modifications made to the FlightSchedulerCSP class, including the addition of a diverted_slot and adjustments to time slot generation and constraints, provides in a custom flight scheduling CSP model. Let's summarize the key aspects of this experiment and compare it with tree-based search algorithms using utility functions.\n",
    "Summary of the Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Time Slot Frequency: The time_slot parameter allows you to set the frequency of time slots. This change enables more precise scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended Time Slot Range: The time slots are generated up to the last possible time considering the disruption level and the time slot interval. This ensures a comprehensive range for rescheduling flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diverted Slot for Unsolvable Conflicts: A diverted_slot set to a future date acts as a fallback for flights that cannot be accommodated. This helps in managing unsolvable conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints Adjustments: The constraint function now accounts for the number of flights scheduled at a time and compares it with the available runway capacity. It also accommodates the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling of Local Minima: The min-conflicts algorithm includes a check to prevent getting stuck in local minima, ensuring that the algorithm provides a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection of Earliest Time Slot: The algorithm selects the earliest time slot that minimizes conflicts, or if not feasible, assigns the flight to the diverted slot.\n",

    "Pros of the CSP Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility in Scheduling: Customizable time slot intervals offer more control over the scheduling process.\n",
    "- Efficient Handling of Conflicts: The ability to divert flights provides a clear solution for otherwise unsolvable scheduling conflicts.\n",
    "- Adaptability to Various Scenarios: The CSP model can adapt to different runway capacities and disruption levels.\n",
    "- Prevention of Stagnation: Safeguards against local minima ensure the algorithm always returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons of the CSP Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased Complexity: The added features and parameters make the model more complex and potentially harder to manage.\n",
    "- Risk of Suboptimal Solutions: The use of a diverted slot, while practical, might lead to suboptimal scheduling outcomes.\n",
    "- Dependence on Parameter Settings: The effectiveness of the model heavily relies on the chosen values for parameters like time_slot and neighbor_window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison with Tree-Based Search Using Utility Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSP vs. Tree-Based Search: CSP focuses on finding a solution that satisfies all constraints, while tree-based search algorithms aim to find an optimal solution based on a utility function.\n",
    "- Handling of Conflicts: CSPs, especially with the addition of the diverted slot, can handle conflicts more flexibly compared to tree-based searches, which might require more complex utility functions to manage similar scenarios.\n",
    "- Scalability and Performance: Tree-based searches can be more computationally intensive, especially for large problem spaces, whereas CSPs with the min-conflicts heuristic can be more efficient in finding satisfactory solutions.\n",
    "- Optimality of Solutions: Tree-based searches are more likely to find the most optimal solution, but at the cost of increased computational effort. In contrast, CSPs may quickly find a satisfactory solution but not necessarily the most optimal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the CSP model is capable to handle large state spaces quickly. While it offers a practical approach to managing unsolvable conflicts, it may not always provide the most optimal scheduling compared to tree-based search algorithms focused on maximizing a utility function."
