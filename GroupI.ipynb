    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach assumes unexpected and immediate conditional deterioration, which leads to the closure of the runways for a period of time. \n",
    "This closure necessitates the rescheduling of flights originally scheduled for that time and all subsequent schedules. The challenge lies in quickly generating a new schedule while optimizing in terms of delay time and number of passengers affected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recognising that the runway is the most constrained resource at an airport, an algorithm is built to allocate a new time slot for each scheduled flight. \n",
    "To simplify the problem, each time slot is assumed to be five minutes and the number of flights assigned to a time slot is defined by the number of runway operable as the airport resumes services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledging that flights with an extended delay time are more likely to be cancelled or diverted due to fuel constraints, a maximum delay time is imposed such that flights that cannot be assigned a time slot within the period would be assumed cancelled. Drawing references to the work of Balakrishan and Chandran (2010), two objective functions are used, both as a function of time delay."

    "## Data\n",

    "This approach has sourced daily-basis data from two major international airports, which are pivotal to the model due to their high traffic and significant impact on global air travel:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Schipol Airport](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/departures/): Flight departure data are scraped from Schipol Airport Departures, which provides comprehensive details on flight schedules, delays, and cancellations. This information is crucial for understanding the baseline operations and for simulating disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hong Kong International Airport](https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/cargo.page): Additional data are collected from Hong Kong International Airport Cargo Departures, offering insights into cargo flight patterns and their interdependencies with commercial passenger flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection process utilizes an automated web scraping. Our main tools and libraries include:\n",
    "Selenium: For automated navigation and interaction with web pages, allowing us to simulate a user's actions to access and retrieve flight information.\n",
    "Beautiful Soup: This library parses HTML and XML documents, making it easier to scrape information from web pages."

    "## Testing Search Problem Algorithm\n",
    "In this notebook, we will test for different scenarios using the custom defined classes and solver algorithms.\n",
    "We will set up the search problem varying the following parameters:\n",
    "* n_runway\n",
    "* max_delay\n",
    "* duration of disruption (by chaning the paramter `resume_hour` and/or `resume_min`)\n",
    "* Number of flights to consider (by changing the df passed into the `search_pronble` class)\n",

    "By default, the `resschedule_problem` class defines the problem with the following parameters:\n",
    "* n_runway = 1\n",
    "* disruption_dur = 60 (in minutes)\n",
    "* duration of time slot = 5 (in minutes)\n",
    "* Maximum delay permissible before a flight has to be diverted = 120\n"

    "- Flexibility in Scheduling: Customizable time slot intervals offer more control over the scheduling process.\n",
    "- Efficient Handling of Conflicts: The ability to divert flights provides a clear solution for otherwise unsolvable scheduling conflicts.\n",
    "- Adaptability to Various Scenarios: The CSP model can adapt to different runway capacities and disruption levels.\n",

    "The modifications made to the FlightSchedulerCSP class, including the addition of a diverted_slot and adjustments to time slot generation and constraints, provides in a custom flight scheduling CSP model. Let's summarize the key aspects of this experiment and compare it with tree-based search algorithms using utility functions.\n",
    "Summary of the Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Time Slot Frequency: The time_slot parameter allows you to set the frequency of time slots. This change enables more precise scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended Time Slot Range: The time slots are generated up to the last possible time considering the disruption level and the time slot interval. This ensures a comprehensive range for rescheduling flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diverted Slot for Unsolvable Conflicts: A diverted_slot set to a future date acts as a fallback for flights that cannot be accommodated. This helps in managing unsolvable conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints Adjustments: The constraint function now accounts for the number of flights scheduled at a time and compares it with the available runway capacity. It also accommodates the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling of Local Minima: The min-conflicts algorithm includes a check to prevent getting stuck in local minima, ensuring that the algorithm provides a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection of Earliest Time Slot: The algorithm selects the earliest time slot that minimizes conflicts, or if not feasible, assigns the flight to the diverted slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison with Tree-Based Search Using Utility Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSP vs. Tree-Based Search: CSP focuses on finding a solution that satisfies all constraints, while tree-based search algorithms aim to find an optimal solution based on a utility function.\n",
    "- Handling of Conflicts: CSPs, especially with the addition of the diverted slot, can handle conflicts more flexibly compared to tree-based searches, which might require more complex utility functions to manage similar scenarios.\n",
    "- Scalability and Performance: Tree-based searches can be more computationally intensive, especially for large problem spaces, whereas CSPs with the min-conflicts heuristic can be more efficient in finding satisfactory solutions.\n",
    "- Optimality of Solutions: Tree-based searches are more likely to find the most optimal solution, but at the cost of increased computational effort. In contrast, CSPs may quickly find a satisfactory solution but not necessarily the most optimal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the CSP model is capable to handle large state spaces quickly. While it offers a practical approach to managing unsolvable conflicts, it may not always provide the most optimal scheduling compared to tree-based search algorithms focused on maximizing a utility function."

    "\n",
    "The second approach focuses on the strategic management of expected disruptions, typically due to adverse weather conditions like typhoons or tornadoes. Unlike the first approach, this method deals with an entire day and assumes the probabilistic nature of disruption. In addition, the model incorporates multiple airports, considering the transition of an aircraft with the given probability of disruption. To address these issues, the second approach minimizes the revenue loss of the entire airports due to the expected disruption. This follows the method from the most cited work (paper: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25768908) and the general network models (book: http://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/AMP-Chapter-08.pdf)."

    "\n",
    "We use real data compiled by Amadeus, made available as part of the [ROADEF 2009 Challenge: Disruption Management for Commercial Aviation](https://www.roadef.org/challenge/2009/en/). This dataset is based on flight plans for an airline in France. For this notebook, we have pre-processed this dataset and stored the information in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current flight plan: The currently planned set of flights and their aircraft assignments assuming that there is no weather disruption (i.e., all airports operate at full capacity).\n",
    "- Aircraft starting and ending positions: Where should each aircraft start the day and end the day? This information is necessary to ensure that aircrafts are where they need to be for the next day so that the disruption does not extend into the next day.\n",
    "- Passenger itinerary: The number of passengers and the price per ticket sold for each flight. This information is useful to assess the revenue brought in by each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though the data used in this example is from 2006, the optimization model is ambivalent of the data. For any new flight plan and predicted future disruption levels, the model will optimally solve the routing and flight service decisions."

    "To evaluate the optimized model, this study also formulates and simulates unoptimized models at a specific disruption level ($\\alpha$ = 0.5). These unoptimized models represent manual flight allocations by airport employees, generated under slightly altered constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual allocation efficiently uses up to 75-95% of the available flights ((0.75-0.95) × \\alpha × total_departure/arrivals), though not as effectively as the computerized optimization model, which can utilize up to 100%.\n",
    "2. Manual allocation cannot evaluate a value of a certain flight in terms of revenue loss because of the urgency nature of rescheduling under disruption. It rather tries to maximize the utilization of flights. \n",
    "3. Manual allocation begins with random operation plans, which is represents human-error, covering 50-95% of available flights. These plans may be adjusted as employees further attempt to optimize within their constraints."
